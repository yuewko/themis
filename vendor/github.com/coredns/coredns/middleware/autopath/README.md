# autopath

The *autopath* middleware allows CoreDNS to perform server side search path completion.
If it sees a query that matches the first element of the configured search path, *autopath* will
follow the chain of search path elements and returns the first reply that is not NXDOMAIN.
On any failures the original reply is returned.

Because *autopath* returns a reply for a name that wasn't the original question it will add a CNAME
that points from the original name (with the search path element in it) to the name of this answer.

## Syntax

~~~
autopath [ZONE..] RESOLV-CONF
~~~

* **ZONES** zones *autopath* should be authoritative for.
* **RESOLV-CONF** points to a `resolv.conf` like file or uses a special syntax to point to another
  middleware. For instance `@kubernetes`, will call out to the kubernetes middleware (for each
  query) to retrieve the search list it should use.

Currently the following set of middleware has implemented *autopath*:

* *kubernetes*
* *erratic*

## Examples

~~~
autopath my-resolv.conf
~~~

Use `my-resolv.conf` as the file to get the search path from. This file only needs so have one line:
`search domain1 domain2 ...`

~~~
autopath @kubernetes
~~~

Use the search path dynamically retrieved from the kubernetes middleware.

## Bugs

When the *cache* middleware is enabled it is possible for pods in different namespaces to get the
same answer.
